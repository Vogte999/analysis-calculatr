# analysis-calculatr
Provides many useful tools for mathematical functions

## what this application is supposed to do in the future:
calculate zeros, calculate extrema, derive, integrate, ... in a command line interface

## what this application can do right now
  - define function: "f(x) = 4xÂ² + 3x - 5"
  - print function: "f(x)"
  - print y-value: "f(3)"
  - print derivative: "derive f(x)"
  - print zeros (experimental): "zeros f(x)"
